# 2.0 format changes


if i were to make an incremental game...
it would be eclectic
it would have cats
and cheese balls
achievements of course
it would need an idle game within the idle game

idle game idle (?!?!)
- multiple idle games within the idle game
- can pay homage to some classics
- and maybe meta-upgrades? 


so like- 
one page is a merge idle (cheese themed? balls -> puffs)
one page is a clicker
one page is an exponential idle
one page is a story-based idle
one page is a clickbait P2W idle with microtransactions
one page is an employment-based idle (software/game dev?)
one page is a runescape-style battler MMORPGidle
one page is a fishing minigame
one page is literally tinder
one page is based on pinball (parody breakout idle)


and outside of the minigames, you would have various meta upgrades... and a couple energy mechanics?
-buy a Nintendo switch: plus gamer thumbs, minus productivity
-get a haircut: plus tinder score, minus MMORPGidle
-get a girlfriend: plus joy, lose access to MMORPGidle
-get girlfriend into gaming: plus clickbait
-get a second monitor: play two games side by side
-gamer chair: 2x clicks per second
-lock in: ...?

oh man- remember that dunkey game jam, the game with 9 in one? that was cool... i don't know about having the stories collide, maybe there are some UI elements i could borrow

oof - this tukkun fella has done some really impressive work in the idle game scene with anti-idle. even their old work, "game in ten seconds" is very cool and a similar concept with minigames and some unique upgrades

but i think my idea could be really cool!
